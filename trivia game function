/*
I think it's important to note that I am not able to call the results to this function by the following means:

1. Assigning the calling of the function to a variable & then calling the variable:
calling ---> var x = triviaFunc(skyColor); & inputing "green" returns ---> I am sorry, green is the incorrect answer.
Fine, so far.
Then:
calling ---> x; returns ---> undefined
Then:
calling ---> x(); returns ---> Uncaught TypeError: x is not a function
*/

/*
Questions to answer:
1. Are functions that return another function more efficient than a function like this one? Why?
